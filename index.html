	<p>Hello Everyone!</p>
<p>
	I am Erik, from Southeast Texas and I'm part of the marketing track in the Startup Institute Chicao spring Class. This is my first time in Chicago and can't wait to immerse myself in the startup community here. A passion of mine is working with small organizations to develop a digital footprint for their brand, and building social communities through social media and content marketing. I look forward to starting a career in Chicago and making memories in the Windy City.
